Project Title:

Liverpool Fan Discussion Board


Project Overview:

The application is designed as a web system that gathers together Liverpool FC fans by facilitating discussions, giving opportunities to air one's views and opinions on the club. They can talk about their favorite player, the most memorable game or match of Liverpool FC. It could be more personal, expressing your love and enthusiasm for Liverpool FC. However, the app gives the user interaction by liking other posts, so the engagement with others in the community is high.


Key Features:

Create Posts: Fans will be able to write and post content with title and content.

Posts Feed: Posts are arranged in a neat feed, showing the most recent ones.

Like System: Users can "like" posts, which indicate appreciation and engagement.

Responsive Design: The application will work fine on both desktop and mobile devices.

Why This Project

I have chosen this project because it is an amalgamation of my passion for Liverpool FC and interest in web development. This project will enable me to learn and implement core MERN stack concepts, such as CRUD operations, database management, and frontend-backend communication. It's a simple yet meaningful project that would improve my ability to build full-stack applications and give me confidence to take on more complex projects in the future. Plus, it's cool to create something that could resonate with fellow Liverpool fans...
